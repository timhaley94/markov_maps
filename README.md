This is a fun little Machine Learning project that allows you to build a maze/map for a
[Q-Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-learning) agent to attempt and learn. It
gives you control over several parameters of the agent, and allows you to update the
map through drag and drop.

### Scripts
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app),
so the usual suspects work:
- `npm install` to install the dependencies (make sure you have a node version >= v8.x.x)
- `npm start` to start the development server
- `npm build` to build the production site
